"""Android/iOS-specific image extraction orchestration.

This module is intentionally separate from the Disk orchestration entrypoint.
It validates that the active service owns the job before invoking the neutral
low-level image engine. Android and iOS services therefore cannot process each
other's jobs even if a task is accidentally published to the wrong broker.
